## Introduction

This project is a robust e-commerce website with an auction system implemented on the AWS Cloud Platform. The project is designed to support diverse auction mechanisms, including Dutch auctions. It integrates stringent security measures using DevSecOps principles and leverages various AWS services such as S3, IAM, KMS, and WAF.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React and React Router for navigation.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Frontend

To start the frontend development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend

The backend is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB for the database.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Backend

To start the backend server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Infrastructure

The infrastructure is managed using AWS CloudFormation.

### AWS IAM Policy

The IAM policy restricts access to the S3 bucket. This configuration is stored in `infrastructure/security-config.json`:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::auction-site-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### AWS CloudFormation

The CloudFormation template sets up various AWS resources. The configuration is stored in `infrastructure/cloudformation.yaml`:

### Deployment

The deployment script automates the build and deployment process. The script is stored in `infrastructure/deploy.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Exit on any non-zero status.
trap 'exit' ERR
set -E

# Build and deploy frontend
echo "Building and deploying frontend..."
cd frontend
npm run build
aws s3 sync build/ s3://auction-site-bucket

# Deploy backend
echo "Deploying backend..."
cd ../backend
eb init -p node.js auction-site --region us-east-1
eb create auction-site-env
eb deploy

# Apply infrastructure changes
echo "Applying infrastructure changes..."
cd ../infrastructure
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file cloudformation.yaml --stack-name auction-site-stack

echo "Deployment completed successfully."
```

To run the deployment script, ensure you have the AWS CLI and Elastic Beanstalk CLI installed and configured. Then, make the script executable and run it:

```bash
cd ecommerce-auction/infrastructure
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## DevSecOps Integration

Security is integrated using DevSecOps principles, with a focus on IAM policies, secure access configurations, and AWS services like KMS for encryption and WAF for application security.
